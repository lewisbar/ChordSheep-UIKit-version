     Install listeners here? (tl;dr: YES!)
     To watch the whole database, I think I would need the following listeners
     - 1 for the login status (maybe not here?)
     - 1 for the bands the user is in (total: 1)
     - 1 for every band's lists (total: = number of bands, for example 2 or 3)
     - 1 for every band's songs (total: = number of bands, for example 2 or 3)
     -> Sum: 2 + (2 * bands.count) = around 2-7
     -> The user would have to be in more than 49 bands to exceed the limit of 100 listeners
     -> I should limit the number of bands for one user to 49 (or less to control db access rates which will eventually cost money; I think 20 bands would be more than enough)
     -> It seems not too much to listen to the whole database all the time.
     -> I think right now I search all bands of all users across the world to find out in which one a particular user is. Maybe I should change the structure there. Not the band saves it users, but the other way around, the user has a dictionary "bandAccess" with bands and access levels. But what if a bandleader wants to see his members? That could be the time to do that other kind of search: Search all users for the bandID. Or, maybe better: The band AND the user both hold a reference to each other. Whenever a user is added to or removed from a band or his access level changes, both the user and the band must be updated. Yes, that's a good idea, because that's a seldom operation, and in that moment you already have a reference to both the user and the band, so you can use those to update both.
