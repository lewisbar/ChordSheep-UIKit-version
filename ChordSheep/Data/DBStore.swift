    // Manipulating objects in the database. To be called by ViewControllers that present the data to the user and let them edit it. In most cases, we just have to make the change in the database. Then the corresponding listener will take care of the rest.
    // Storing
    // In general, I want to first change the data locally and then I write them to the database. If I would instead only write to the database and then rely on the listeners to update my local data, I would always have to wait for the data to be updated. This would lead to strange misbehavior, for example when deleting a song in a tableview. ViewControllers must also update their interface directly instead of waiting for the listener callback. Otherwise, you could, for example, get an out-of-bounds error when deleting the last song if it's already been deleted in the model, but the view hasn't received the update yet.

    /*
     Install listeners here? (tl;dr: YES!)
     To watch the whole database, I think I would need the following listeners
     - 1 for the login status (maybe not here?)
     - 1 for the bands the user is in (total: 1)
     - 1 for every band's lists (total: = number of bands, for example 2 or 3)
     - 1 for every band's songs (total: = number of bands, for example 2 or 3)
     -> Sum: 2 + (2 * bands.count) = around 2-7
     -> The user would have to be in more than 49 bands to exceed the limit of 100 listeners
     -> I should limit the number of bands for one user to 49 (or less to control db access rates which will eventually cost money; I think 20 bands would be more than enough)
     -> It seems not too much to listen to the whole database all the time.
     -> I think right now I search all bands of all users across the world to find out in which one a particular user is. Maybe I should change the structure there. Not the band saves its users, but the other way around, the user has a dictionary "bandAccess" with bands and access levels. But what if a bandleader wants to see his members? That could be the time to do that other kind of search: Search all users for the bandID. Or, maybe better: The band AND the user both hold a reference to each other. Whenever a user is added to or removed from a band or his access level changes, both the user and the band must be updated. Yes, that's a good idea, because that's a seldom operation, and in that moment you already have a reference to both the user and the band, so you can use those to update both.
     -> Update: Firebase works so efficiently, the speed only depends on the result, not on the number of documents to be searched. So I don't need the user to store a list of his bands.
